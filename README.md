# Restaurant-Expert-System
I have made this project using prolog.
This is an Restaurant Expert System which has following features:-
1.Find menu for particular restaurant
2.See available Restaurants
3.Search Restaurants by location
4.Find food in particular city
5.Explore Combo offers
6.Explore offer for specific food
7.Explore offer for specific Restaurant
8.Explore types of Pizzas
9.Explore types of Burgers
10.See Food Ratings

You can simply download the RestaurantExpertSystem.zip folder and you can run .pro file on your prolog.
The screenshots of the output is also available in that zip folder...
